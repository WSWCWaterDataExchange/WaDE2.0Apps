Steps to take to build Aggregate Data App

1) Export tables from WaDE Database to csv. Tables needed: dontopen_AggLJAll.csv, dontopen_RU.csv.
2) Pre-processes csv in Jupyter Notebook.  The goal is to combine ReportingUnits.csv with shapefiles via a custom TypeNameNum or TypeIDNum field. Export processed (p) csv.
3) Add p-csv for reporting units into the geodatabase of ArcGIS Pro.
4) Find shapefiles of areas of interest (state provdied) and add data into ArcGIS Pro.
5) Add TypeNameNum (text, 255) or TypeIDNum (text, 255) fields to shp files, follow same logic as p-csv (see below).
6) Join shapefile to p-csv via TypeNameNum or TypeIDNum field (either or, whatever fits best for shp file).  Then export shapefileJoin as new file.  Remove unwanted fields from shapefileJoin.
7) Inspect joined shp and p-csv shapefile, look for errors.
8) Selected wanted rows from shp, export as new shp_v? file within ArcGIS Pro.
9) Inspect and delete unnecessary columns and rows from shp_v?.
10) Export shp_v? to folder as shp file.  WARNING: Shp format outside ArcGIS won't maintain field names, have to manually enter them back in within R.

####### Notes #######
#####################
1) TypeIDNum seems to work beter, issue in CA DAUCO (county) shapefile of shapes sharing same name, but thankfully NOT the ID's.
