Steps to take to build Aggregate Data App

1) Export tables from WaDE Database to csv.
2) Pre-processes csv in Jupyter Notebook.  We combine ReportingUnits.csv with shapefiles via a custom TypeNameNum field. Export processed (p) csv.

States County "1_" + !NAME! + "_" + !StateNum!
Utah HUC: "2_" + !HUC_8! + "_" + !StateNum!
WY and TX Basin: "3_" + !RU_Name! + "_" + !StateNum!
California DAUCO: "4_" + !RU_ID! + "_" + !StateNum!
Arizona AMA: "5_" + !NAME_ABBR! + "_48"
USBR UCRB Triburary: "6_" + !Name! + "_" + !StateNum!
Utah Subarea: "7_" + !RU_Name! + "_" + !StateNum!

3) Add data the p-csv and then export back into the geodatabase of ArcGIS Pro.
4) Find shapefiles of areas of interest and add data into ArcGIS Pro.
5) Add TypeNameNum filed to shp files, follow same logic as p-csv.
6) Join shapefile to p-csv via TypeNameNum field.  
7) Inspect joined shp and p-csv shapefile, look for errors.
8) Selected wanted rows from shp, export as new shp_v2 file within ArcGIS Pro.
9) Inspect and delete unnecessary columns and rows from shp_v2.
10) Export shp_v2 to folder as shp file.  WARNING: Shp format outside ArcGIS won't maintain field names, have to manually enter them back in within R.
