1) Mapdeck uses a special coloring funciton.  Still uses HEX code, but have to add a "FF" to the end of each one.
2) Need to use library(sf) & sf::st_read() function to work with shapefiles in MapDeck.
3) Error with Mapdeck.  Does not return 'id' value.  Have to scape by this by returning index value, create new dataframe, and use that to find SiteUUID from click event.
