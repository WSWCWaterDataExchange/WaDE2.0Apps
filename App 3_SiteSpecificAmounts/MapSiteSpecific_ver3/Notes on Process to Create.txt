Process to Create:
1) Input tables / shapefile from custom SQL queries in SS data file.
2) For creating the LinksSF shapefile in ArcGIS Pro...
	-> remove duplicate rows from csv.
	-> create point file using POU lat and long 
	-> create LinkID field, caculate to row value.
	-> generate xy-to-line using start and end long & lats.
	-> perform join on site file to maintain POU and POD SiteUUIDs & CommunityWaterSupplySystem fields.
	-> remmove unused fields from join.
	-> export shapefile.
3) WaterSourceType & CommunityWaterSupplySystem line plots only use data associated with BeneficialUseCV = "Total (DCII)".

Data Findings:
1) SiteVariableAmounts_fact wise, our POD plots share the same Amounts by ReportYearCV values with their POUs.  That is also true from the upload-to-WaDE data files.
2) Issue of discrepancy in WaterSourceTypeCV between sites.  All POUs are Unspecified, while PODs on map are a mix of Surface Water & Groundwater.

Questions:
1) Can I make a play animation, that shows when a link occurs & when it doesn't?  Do I need to do that anyways if there are no gap years and the POUs-PODs share the same Amount per ReportYearCV?

Creation / Experimentation Note:
1) Issue of trying to use custom marker icons.  Slows down the proecssing speed of the map considerably. Reducing file size of images did not help.
2) Was able to create site highlight optoin for ComunityWaterSupplySystem groups using the addCircleMarkers() function instead of addCircles().  Can't use addCircles() as existing sites are removed upon new click.
3) Having issues with mapdeck().  
	a) Problems of radius_max_pixels() & radius_min_pixels() cannot accept unique values.
	b) fill_colour() requires a hex color code.  fill_opacity() will not work if a hex color code is used (?). Having dificulty geting the alapha of the hex color code to be recognized.
	c) To use more than one add_scatterplot(), be sure to use the layer_id arguments. So issue of trying to map ss sites with wr sites.
4) For similar ss to wr sites...
	a) looking at a map / overlay, it does appear there are some ss sites that are similar to wr sites.
	b) no similar ID to use (i.e., SiteNativeID).
	c) ss & wr sites with similar Longitude or Latitude, but not both.  This could be an issue of spatial exention from the source data (i.e., the agecines not using the same type).
	d) No similar site names between ss & wr, but there are sites that share a similar naming convention.


Notes:
1) Issues with creating links from WaDE.  Need to spend some time with DPL and see if I'm doing a delete cascade correlty.
	a) Create links using WaDE input file instead and some ArcGIS Joins until I had a start & end lat & long for POUs-to-PODs.
